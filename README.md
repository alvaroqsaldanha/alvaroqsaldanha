### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc Computer Engineering student at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, Portugal, specializing in Information Systems and Data Science. I'm passionate for fullstack software development and machine learning and currently looking to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of some projects I've developed over the last few years! Thank you for visiting :)!
