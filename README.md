### Hello! 👋👋👋

I'm a MSc Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico, specializing in Data Science, and a Software Engineer intern at Unit4. I'm passionate about full-stack software development and machine learning, and always look for opportunities to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of projects I've developed over the last few years! 

I am currently keeping busy with:

💻 A pre-thesis project about Polyphonic Sound Event Detection for urban soundscapes (inspired by the [DCASE](https://dcase.community/) challenge). I plan to study federated learning, knowledge distillation, and multiple DNN architectures applied to this domain. <br>
🔋 A software engineering internship at Unit4, from April to July 2023, using ReactJS, .NET, and Azure DevOps. <br>
🗾 Japanese language classes, towards a N5 level. <br>

Thank you for visiting :)
