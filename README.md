### Hello! 👋👋👋

I'm a MSc Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal, specializing in data science. I'm passionate about full-stack software development and machine learning, and always look for opportunities to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of projects I've developed over the last few years! 

I am currently keeping busy with:

💻 A pre-thesis project titled "Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events in Urban Soundscapes with Deep Neural Networks". <br>
🗾 Japanese language classes, towards a N5 level. <br>
🔋 An incoming software engineering internship at Unit4, from April to July 2023.

Thank you for visiting :)
