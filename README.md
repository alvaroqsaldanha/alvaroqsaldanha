### Hello! ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹ğŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Data Science. I'm passionate about full-stack software development and machine learning, and always look for opportunities to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of projects I've developed over the last few years! 

Currently I am working on my MSc Thesis, on Self-supervised Learning and Explainability for Facial Deepfake Detection in videos and images, as a Research Intern at the Echizen Laboratory of the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan, and looking for my next big opportunity for September/October 2025!
