### Hello! 👋👋👋

I'm a MSc Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico, specializing in Data Science. I'm passionate about full-stack software development and machine learning, and always look for opportunities to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of projects I've developed over the last few years! 
Currently, I am living in Tokyo, Japan, as part of the Vulcanus in Japan 2023/2024 programme, consisting of a 4-month intensive Japanese language course, followed by an 8-month Software Engineering internship. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in Japan, focusing on data science and deep learning research.
