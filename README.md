### Hello! 👋👋👋

I'm a MSc Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico, specializing in Data Science, and a Software Engineer intern at Unit4. I'm passionate about full-stack software development and machine learning, and always look for opportunities to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of projects I've developed over the last few years! 
Currently, I am working on pre-thesis project about Polyphonic Sound Event Detection for Urban Soundscapes (inspired by the [DCASE](https://dcase.community/)  challenge). I plan to study federated learning, knowledge distillation, and multiple DNN architectures applied to this domain.
