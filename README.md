### Hello! 👋👋👋

I'm a MSc Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico, specializing in Data Science, and a Software Engineer intern at Unit4. I'm passionate about full-stack software development and machine learning, and always look for opportunities to further develop my skillset in these areas. This page is a collection of projects I've developed over the last few years!

  &nbsp; I am currently keeping busy with:

  &nbsp; 💻 A pre-thesis project about Polyphonic Sound Event Detection for Urban Soundscapes (inspired by the [DCASE](https://dcase.community/) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; challenge). I plan to  study federated learning, knowledge distillation, and multiple DNN architectures applied to &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this domain. <br>
  &nbsp; 🔋 A software engineering internship at Unit4, from April to July 2023, using ReactJS, .NET, and Azure DevOps. <br>
  &nbsp; 🗾 Studying Japanese, Reinforcement Learning, and NLP. <br>

  &nbsp; Thank you for visiting :)
